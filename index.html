<h1><center>Welcome to David's Website!</center></h1>
<b><p>(8/25/23)</b><br>This is the first weekly reflection for the engineering course! On monday, we didnt really do much, it was more of introduction. He introduced himself more thoroughly and went through the syllabus for the year. We then went to aws and connected our github accounts to the cloud9 server. On wednesday, There was no wifi so we just hung aroung the classroom and chilled. On friday, we had this fun activity outside where we had to try and roll the marble using pipes into a small cup. Overall it was a fun week but it wasnt focused on academics as much as other weeks will so we'll see</p>

<b><p>(9/11/23)</b><br>Last week, on monday, we drafted what our rube goldberg project would look like and shared a cadding file on tinkercad with all of the group members. On Wednesday, the person witht he draft wasnt here so we tried to cad as much as we remembered. He wasnt here on friday either, so we had to improvise and made a rough draft out of what we memebered but unfortunately we did not get to start on actually building the project :( </p>

<b><p>(9/25/23)</b><br>Last week, on monday, we hadnt quite finished our rube goldberg machine so we had to delay it to wednesday, where we finished it in class and also did a fun challenge, where we had to compete to keep metal scraps afloat in water using 1 sheet of paper. On friday, we had an intro to computer engineering but the wfi was so bad that we had to move to Mr. Kims math classroom. When we moved up to his math classroom where we watched a video introducing us to the subject and took notes on it. Thats basically the summary of what we did throughout the week:)</p>

<b><p>(9/30/23)</b><br>This week, we started our computer engineering chapter where we took notes on wednesday, and then on friday, we had to take apart a computer but unfortunately when we put it back together, it didnt turn on since it was missing the ram.</p>

<b><p>(10/6/23)</b><br>This week on monday, we took a quiz on computer engineering but then on wednesday, we took notes on bioengineering and made a prosthetic arm which was pretty good. Today on friday, we took notes on some slides and kept on working on our prosthetic hands that we made on wednesday. It was overall a fun week:)</p>

<b><p>(10/20/23)</b><br>This week, we've been learning about aerospace engineering which is personally my favorite feild. As a quick small project for this feild, we made rockets out of 2 liter bottles. To start with this project, on monday, we made a cad design of what we were going to build for our rocket. On wednesday, we worked on the actual process of building the rocket on the bottle base which didnt take too long. Then on friday, we went to shoot the rockets but on the first try, we didnt fill it up with enough feul (water) so it didnt work well but Mr. Kim let us retry at the end, and our rocket ended up going the furthest. It was overall a fun build and I enjoyed doing all of the work we did :)</p>

<b><p>(10/27/23)</b><br>This week was a short week so we only had 2 class days together so on the first day which was on tuesday, we went through slides and took notes about enviornmental engineering and how its used today. Then on thursday, we tried to apply some of the things we learned into a fun activity where we had to try and filter very dirty water contaminated with mud and other things and me and Jordan had the cleanest water result which was prolly because we patted everything down to try and make it as condense as possible so that it picked up as much dirt particles as possible. It was overall a fun week and I enjoyed the new things we learned and did but unfortunately we have a quiz about it next week:(:</p>

<b><p>(12/1/23)</b><br>This week after taking notes on buisness engineering, we had to decide what product to make in order to approach the classroom with a sharktank like proposal. I couldnt remember what i ate for dinner the night before the start of the project so i decided to make a device that records your day to day life called "IMemory". This product comes in both eye glass form and contact lense form. Me and Jordan made a very cool slideshow presenting the audience with all information about our product and a final offer that we felt was reasonable. Jordan was not here on the presentation day so I had to do it alone and it still went pretty smoothly. I enjoyed learning about buisness engineering and it was pretty fun to work with a partner to get it done(:</p>

  <ol type="1">
  <li>Our bridge weighed 28.1 grams</li>
  <li>Our bridge held 829.6 grams </li>
  <li>Our score was 29.8 </li>
  <li>We didnt use that much glue, but that was probably what contributed to most of the weight for our bridge since spagetti is light. </li>
  <li>The design for our bridge came from the idea that triangles are the most structurally supportive shape so we based our bridge off of series of triangles that supported the beams we placed across to properly structure our design. </li>
  <li>Yes it worked as intended and it actually held more weight than i thought it could. </li>
  <li>The ends that were meant to be placed on the table snapped so it wasnt really our design that failed, rather the strength of the people holding the bridge. </li>
  <li>Maybe we couldve made the ends longer. </li>

<b><p>(1/12/24)</b><br>This week after taking notes on chemical engineering, our mini project for this subject was making oobleck, a substance that is liquid when applied with a light force, but solid when a strong force is applied. Most of the other groups had an unaffective approach to making this substance which consisted of water and cornstarch, but I came up with the idea of pouring all the cornstarch into the bowl and then slowly adding water untill it forms which turned out to be the best approach so me and jordan had the best oobleck from the whole class. After it was made, we played with it a little bit and it had a really weird consistency that was fun to play with and the spoon we were using to play with it almost snapped because we applied a hard force to the oobleck so it acted as a solid. It was a fun project that i enjoyed a lot:) </p>

<b><p>(2/14/24)</b><br>3 weeks ago we started the first of our big projects which is building a mouse trap car with only using a mouse trap, string, cardboard, and skewers. We also had the option to to and electrical car using arduino, but me and jordan decided to do the mousetrap car. Honestly i got really sick for the first 2 weeks of the mouse trap car which was picking a design, making a cad, and the start of building so I was a little behind. Once Jordan caught me up, I started implementing some ideas i had like how to wind the car and what type of string to use which was the fishing wire. Once our first design was built, we went to test it and it drove 80 feet which was approximately what we calculated so so far everything is going as planned and hopefully our seccond design will go even further:)</p>

<b><p>(2/23/24)</b><br>This week, we started building our 2nd mouse trap itteration but Jordan was gone the whole time and he knew what our new design was going to look like so I had to change it up a little bit and attempt to make the design for our first itteration but while tweaking some thing about it. I changed the layout of the wheels and the length of the winding a little bit and it worked better than the first one so the next class period i was feeling pretty good about the car. During the test, my winding went wrong and it failed so I was really dissapointed. We had some spare time so Mr. Kim let us do 2nd tries and this time I made sure it was winded correctly so that it doesnt fail again and when we put it to the test, it made it all the way to the end of the cafeteria so i was happy about it. Jordan again wasnt there to see it so i dont have a video of the origional one but we went and tested it again outside and even after i cut the video it was still rolling. The total was approximately 90 feet and i was happy about it.</p>

<b><p>(3/6/24)</b><br>This week, we started another one of our projects which was the eggdrop design so first on monday, we cadded our design which used 14 straws to build a pyramid for the egg then add legs that stick out from each side of the pyramid to protect the fall. We also decided to add parachute so that it lands softer. On friday, we will test to see if it cracks or not when dropped from the third story of the 1000 building, right next to Mr. Pooles classroom.</p>

<b><p>(3/8/24)</b><br>Today we tested our design for the eggdrop but first, me and Jordan helped set up the landing spot for the eggs because apparently they stain the floor and cant be washed away so we cut up a bunch of plastic bags and taped them to the floor. Now it was time for our eggdrop so i went to drop it while Jordan recorded but unfortunately, it cracked because central pyramid was too small and when it landed the egg was to revealed and it cracked, eventually shattering. this was really dissapointing especially since mine and Jordans designs usually are the best of the class and this time, it failed because we made the pryamid too small. Our design wouldve for sure used the least amount of materials and wouldve been the best if the triange was just a little bit bigger.</p>
