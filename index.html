<h1><center>Welcome to David's Website!</center></h1>
<b><p>(8/25/23)</b><br>This is the first weekly reflection for the engineering course! On monday, we didnt really do much, it was more of introduction. He introduced himself more thoroughly and went through the syllabus for the year. We then went to aws and connected our github accounts to the cloud9 server. On wednesday, There was no wifi so we just hung aroung the classroom and chilled. On friday, we had this fun activity outside where we had to try and roll the marble using pipes into a small cup. Overall it was a fun week but it wasnt focused on academics as much as other weeks will so we'll see</p>

<b><p>(9/11/23)</b><br>Last week, on monday, we drafted what our rube goldberg project would look like and shared a cadding file on tinkercad with all of the group members. On Wednesday, the person witht he draft wasnt here so we tried to cad as much as we remembered. He wasnt here on friday either, so we had to improvise and made a rough draft out of what we memebered but unfortunately we did not get to start on actually building the project :( </p>
